all-asms:
- fcntl.h: switch back for O_DIRECT from 02000000 to 040000 ignored;
  see http://lwn.net/2001/0621/a/api-changes.php3
- fcntl.h: consider addition of O_ATOMICLOOKUP to rest of the archs
  (it's already in i386, alpha, sparc*, ppc)
- processor.h: ignored changes (eg. INIT_MMAP definiton). Dunno what they are
  supposed to do. Consider removal.
- unistd.h: all changes ignored. Either dunno what they're for or look obsolete
  (definitions of things that shouldn't really be defined etc.)

alpha:
- ignored switch from apecs_iounmap(unsigned long addr) to 
  apecs_iounmap(unsigned addr) in core_apecs.h
- current.h is different now: struct task_struct wasn't added
- elf.h: modifications ignored since they were inside #ifdef __KERNEL__
- hardirq.h: ignored addition of release_irqlock macro. This file looks like
  __KERNEL__ only
- keyboard.h doesn't exist
- mc146818rtc.h: ignored definition of RTC_IRQ. This file seems __KERNEL__ only
- param.h: ignored ifdef __KERNEL__
- rwsem.h, semaphore.h: ignored changing includes from linux/compiler.h to
  asm/compiler.h. Seems wierd.
- smp.h: ignored. Looks like kernel only header.
- smplock.h doesn't exist
- ignored addition of syscall.h... it's empty
- vga.h: ignored addition of some things - if it's not defined here, it's
  not handled by the kernel (I think). On top of it looks like kernel header :)

i386:
- consider removal: apic.h, apicdef.h, bugs.h, cobalt.h, current.h, delay.h,
  desc.h, div64.h, fixmap.h, floppy.h, hardirq.h, io_apic.h, kmap_types.h,
  linux_logo.h, lithium.h, mca_dma.h, mmu_context.h, mmx.h, parport.h, 
  pgtable-level2.h, pgtable-level3.h, pgtable.h, smp.h, smpboot.h, smplock.h,
  softirq.h, uaccess.h, xor.h
- Userspace warnings (or above): atomic.h, bitops.h, byteorder.h, checksum.h,
  dma.h, ide.h, io.h, kernel.h, module.h, mpspec.h, msr.h, pci.h, rwlock.h,
- Removal of __KERNEL__: bitops.h, highmem.h, page.h, ptrace.h, resource.h,
  rwsem.h, semaphore.h, siginfo.h, signal.h, spinlock.h, string.h, system.h,
  termios.h, vm86.h, 
- elf.h: changes ignored: inside __KERNEL__ (file considered for removal)
- elf.h, elfmark.h: consider addition of elfmark.h
- hw_irq: file changed, so couldn't apply modifications. Consider removal
- ioctls.h: already applied
- ldt.h: file changed
- namei.h: check it
- pgalloc.h: file changed. Modifications not applied. Consider removal.
- scatterlist.h: changes ignored. Looks like kernel file.
- string-486.h: added warning
- syscall.h: dunno if this file is used. Needs checking.
