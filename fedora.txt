alpha:
- ignored switch from apecs_iounmap(unsigned long addr) to 
  apecs_iounmap(unsigned addr) in core_apecs.h
- current.h is different now: struct task_struct wasn't added
- elf.h: modifications ignored since they were inside #ifdef __KERNEL__
- fcntl.h: switch back for O_DIRECT from 02000000 to 040000 ignored;
  see http://lwn.net/2001/0621/a/api-changes.php3
- hardirq.h: ignored addition of release_irqlock macro. This file looks like
  __KERNEL__ only
- keyboard.h doesn't exist
- mc146818rtc.h: ignored definition of RTC_IRQ. This file seems __KERNEL__ only
- param.h: ignored ifdef __KERNEL__
- processor.h: ignored changes (eg. INIT_MMAP definiton). Dunno what they are
  supposed to do
- rwsem.h, semaphore.h: ignored changing includes from linux/compiler.h to
  asm/compiler.h. Seems wierd.
- smp.h: ignored. Looks like kernel only header.
- smplock.h doesn't exist
- ignored addition of syscall.h... it's empty
- unistd.h: all changes ignored. Either dunno what they're for or look obsolete
  (definitions of things that shouldn't really be defined etc.)
- vga.h: ignored addition of some things - if it's not defined here, it's
  not handled by the kernel (I think). On top of it looks like kernel header :)
